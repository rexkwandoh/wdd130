    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>
      <h4>White Water Rafting Site</h4>
      This is a project from school where I learned the basics of html and css design. It was a rough learning curve but it is my first real website so I am proud of it
      as it was my first real success in developing and designing a web page. It was geared towards attracting people aged 20-35 who wanted to take an exciting vacation
      with their families, friends, or individually. It sits in my GitHub repository as a reminder that web development is possible for me. I faced many challenges along
      the way of designing and building it, most of which had to do with learning all of the terms I had to then try to apply to this project with some level of understanding.

      <h4>Personal Portfolio Page</h4>
      This is a placeholder for project. I will replace this with an actual project once I have another one, and add the details of that project.

      <h4>My First App</h4>
      This is the second App I've ever designed, but the first that was on my own. The idea behind this app was to provide a source for readers who wanted to read without
      being exposed to undesired or perceived innapropriate content and for parents who are concered with the assigned reading that their kids are given through school
      assignments. This one was just a prototype as I designed it to partner with a reading App like Audible or Libby that already holds the data of the book an individually
      wants to read.

        <h3>Certificates</h3>
    <p>Below I have listed images of my Degree and Certificates that I have earned in Software Engineering that helped me accomplish the above projects, and more. So far I have a 
      Bachelor's Degree and a Certificate in Computer Programming. I am planning on continuing my education throughout life and will continually add certificates to this section that
      are relevant to my work.
