        Hello, I'm Austin Eaquinto. I live in Rexburg, Idaho with my wife and kids. I enjoy spending time with my family
        or alone, working on my pet projects.
        I've worked in food service, both fast food and restaraunt. I've also worked as an auto mechanic for a few
        years, I even did a short gig as a receptionist
        for a post acute care center. Currently I am a stay at home Dad while I pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Software
        Engineering. My current studies are my first
        look into the computing world and it has been a satisfying and enjoyable experience. The following are to give
        you an idea of the kind of person I am. I enjoy
        organization and respect timelines. Figuring out a problem with my hands or with a pencil and paper might as
        well be a hobby because I find them so fun.
