    <b>Michael DeMartini</b> - He is an advisor in my life. I can turn to him for opinions on any invents in my life or get advice on choices I have to make. He actually
      ended up marrying one of my older sisters and now I can reach out to him as an older brother that I look up to.

    <p class="dave">
    <b>Dave Johnston</b> - A mentor of mine. We went to church together and I grew up with his son so he was already fairly involved in my life. He kept an eye out 
      for me and I still admire the work he does.
    </p>
    <p class="wade">
    <b>Wade Denna</b> - Business Partner. We worked together on starting a cookie business. He had the recipe, materials, and finances while I handled the baking,
