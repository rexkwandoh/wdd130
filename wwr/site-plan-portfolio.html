        Hello, I'm Austin Eaquinto. I live in Rexburg, Idaho with my wife and kids. I enjoy spending time with my family or alone, working on my pet projects.
        I've worked in food service, both fast food and restaraunt. I've also worked as an auto mechanic for a few years, I even did a short gig as a receptionist
        for a post acute care center. Currently I am a stay at home Dad while I pursue my Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering. My current studies are my first
        look into the computing world and it has been a satisfying and enjoyable experience. The following are to give you an idea of the kind of person I am. I enjoy 
        organization and respect timelines. Figuring out a problem with my hands or with a pencil and paper might as well be a hobby because I find them so fun. I strive 
        to give my best effort in my work and to be honest in all of my interactions and dealings with people. I am confident in my knowledge like to push myself to 
        learn as much as I can. As you peruse my website you will find projects that I have worked on and my personal contact information. Please look through my 
        work and if you like what you see I look forward to hearing from you.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        White Water Rafting Site
        This is a project from school where I learned the basics of html and css design. It was a rough learning curve but it is my first real website so I am proud of it
        as it was my first real success in developing and designing a web page. It was geared towards attracting people aged 20-35 who wanted to take an exciting vacation
        with their families, friends, or individually.

        Personal Portfolio Page
        This is a placeholder for project. I will replace this with an actual project once I have another one, and add the details of that project.

        Below I have listed images of my Degree and Certificates that I have earned in Software Engineering that helped me accomplish the above projects, and more.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The education will include some actual information, but the rest like my degree
        that I plan to graduate in will be added in as an example of what the page could look 
        like.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>         
        My current projects from this class will be placeholders here, but they will be 
        changed out once other projects are completed in the futre.

      <h3>References and Contact Information</h3>
      <p>         
        The references will be people I know. The work history will be my current work
        history that has nothing to do with software engineering but I'm only using it
        as a placeholder and it will be replaced once I have the relevant work history.
