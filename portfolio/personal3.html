      Michael DeMartini - He is an advisor in my life. I can turn to him for opinions on any invents in my life or get advice on choices I have to make. He actually
      ended up marrying one of my older sisters and now I can reach out to him as an older brother that I look up to.

      Dave Johnston - A mentor of mine. We went to church together and I grew up with his son so he was already fairly involved in my life. He kept an eye out 
      for me and I still admire the work he does.

      Wade Denna - Business Partner. We worked together on starting a cookie business. He had the recipe, materials, and finances while I handled the baking,
      sales, and marketing.
