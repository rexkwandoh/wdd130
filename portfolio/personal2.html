    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>
      <h4>White Water Rafting Site</h4>
      This is a project from school where I learned the basics of html and css design. It was a rough learning curve but it is my first real website so I am proud of it
      as it was my first real success in developing and designing a web page. It was geared towards attracting people aged 20-35 who wanted to take an exciting vacation
      with their families, friends, or individually.

      <h4>Personal Portfolio Page</h4>
      This is a placeholder for project. I will replace this with an actual project once I have another one, and add the details of that project.
